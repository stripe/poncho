# Poncho

Poncho is an API to build APIs or, in other words, a DSL to build REST interfaces.

It'll validate input and output, coerce values and is easily extendable with custom data types.

It's compatible with any rack-based framework, such as Rails or Sinatra.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'poncho'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install poncho

## TLDR Usage

    class ChargeResource < Poncho::Resource
      param :amount, :type => :integer
      param :currency

      def currency
        super || 'USD'
      end
    end

    class ChargeCreateMethod < Poncho::JSONMethod
      param :amount, :type => :integer, :required => true
      param :currency, :in => ['USD', 'GBP']

      def invoke
        charge = Charge.new
        charge.amount = param(:amount)
        charge.currency = param(:currency)
        charge.save

        ChargeResource.new(charge)
      end
    end

    post '/charges', &ChargeCreateMethod

## Getting started with Methods

Methods inherit from `Poncho::Method` and override `invoke`, where they perform any necessary logic.

In a similar vein to Sinatra, anything returned from `invoke` is sent right back to the user. You can
return a http status code, a body string, or even a Rack response array.

    class ChargeListMethod < Poncho::Method
      def invoke
        # Some DB shizzle

        200
      end
    end

To invoke the method just add it to your routes.

Using Rails:

    match '/users' => UsersListMethod, :via => :get

Using Sinatra:

    get '/users', &UsersListMethod

Or invoke manually:

    UsersListMethod.call(rack_env)

If you're writing a JSON API, you'll probably want to inherit the Method from `Poncho::JSONMethod` instead of
`Poncho::Method`, but we'll cover that later.

## Params

You can get access to the request params, via the `params` or `param(name)` methods.

Before you can use a param though, you need to define it:

    param :param_name

By default, param are of type 'string'. you can choose a different type via the `:type` option:

    param :amount, :type => :integer

There are a bunch of predefined types, such as `:integer`, `:array`, `:boolean_string` etc, but you can
also easily define your own custom ones (covered later).

Poncho will automatically validate that if a paramter is provided it is in a valid format.
Poncho will also handle type conversion for you.

So for example, in the case above, Poncho will automatically validate that the `amount` param is
indeed an Integer or an Integer string, and will coerce the parameter into an integer when you try to access it.

## Validation

As well as the default type validation, Poncho lets you validate presence, format, length and much more!

For example, to validate that a `:currency` parameter is provided, pass in the `:presence' option:

    param :currency, :presence => true

To validate that a currency is either 'USD' or 'GBP', use the `:in` option.

    param :currency, :in => ['USD', 'GBP']

The other supported validations out of the box are `:format`, `:not_in`, and `:length`:

    param :email, :format => /@/
    param :password, :length => 5..20

## Custom Validation

You can use a custom validator via the `validate` method, passing in a block:

    validate do
      unless param(:customer_id) ~= /\Acus_/
        errors.add(:customer_id, :invalid_customer)
      end
    end

    # Or

    validates :customer_id, :customer_validate

Alternatively, if your validation is being used in multiple places, you can wrap it up in a class and
pass it to the `validates_with` method.

    validates_with CustomValidator

For a good example of how to build validations, see the [
existing ones](https://github.com/stripe/poncho/tree/master/lib/poncho/validations).

## Custom Params

As your API grows you'll probably start to need custom parameter types. These can be useful to ensure
parameters are both valid and converted into suitable values.

To define a custom parameter, simply inherit from `Poncho::Param`. For example, let's define a new param called
`CardHashParam`. It needs to validate input via overriding the `validate_each` method, and convert input via
overriding the `convert` method.

      module Poncho
        module Params
          class CardHashParam < Param
            def validate_each(method, attribute, value)
              value = convert(value)

              unless value.is_a?(Hash) && value.keys == [:number, :exp_month, :exp_year, :cvc]
                method.errors.add(attribute, :invalid_card_hash, options.merge(:value => value))
              end
            end

            def convert(value)
              value && value.symbolize_keys
            end
          end
        end
      end

You can use custom parameters via the `:type` option.

    param :card, :type => Poncho::Params::CardHashParam

    # Or the shortcut
    param :card, :type => :card_hash

## Request & Response

You can gain access to the rack request via the `request` method, for example:

    def invoke
     accept = request.headers['Accept']
     200
    end

The same goes for the response object:

    def invoke
      response.body = ['Fee-fi-fo-fum']
      200
    end

There are some helper methods to set such things as the HTTP status response codes and body.

    def invoke
      status 201
      body 'Created!'
    end

## Method filters

There are various filters you can apply to the request, for example:

    class MyMethod < Poncho::Method
      before_validation do
        # Before validation
      end

      before do
        # Before invoke
        p params
      end

      after do
        # After invocation
      end
    end

## Error responses

You can provide custom responses to exceptions via the `error` class method.

Pass `error` a exception type or status code.

    class MyMethod < Poncho::Method
      error MyCustomClass do
        'Sorry, something went wrong.'
      end

      error 403 do
        'Not authorized.'
      end
    end

## JSON APIs

If your API only returns JSON then Poncho has a convenient `JSONMethod` class which
will ensure that all response bodies are converted into JSON and that the correct content type
header is set.

    class TokenCreateMethod < Poncho::JSONMethod
      param :number, :required => true

      def invoke
        {:token => '123'}
      end
    end

`JSONMethod` also ensures that there's valid JSON error responses to 404s and 500s, as well
as returning a JSON error hash for validation errors.

    $ curl http://localhost:4567/tokens -d number=
      {"error":{"param":"number","type":"presence"}

## Resources

Resources are wrappers around other classes, such as models, providing a view representation of them.

You can specify attributes to be returned to the client using the same `param` syntax as documented above.

    class Card
      attr_reader :number

      def initialize(number)
        @number = number
      end
    end

    class CardResource < Poncho::Resource
      param :number
      param :description

      def number
        super[-4..-1]
      end
    end

As you can see in the example above, you can override params and return a custom response.

When the `Resource` instance is converted into JSON the appropriate params will be used and serialized.

    class ChargeResource < Poncho::Resource
      param :amount, :type => :integer
      param :currency
      param :card, :resource => CardResource

      def currency
        super || 'USD'
      end
    end

    class ChargeListMethod < Poncho::JSONMethod
      def invoke
        [
          ChargeResource.new(Charge.new(1000, 'USD')),
          ChargeResource.new(Charge.new(50, 'USD'))
        ]
      end
    end

If a particular param points to another resource, you can use the `:type => :resource` option as demonstrated above.
